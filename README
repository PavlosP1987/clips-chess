This is a CLIPS (http://clipsrules.sourceforge.net/rule) based system
that plays white king-rook against black king endgame.  To start a
game, after loading chessl.clp, use (start-game).  Playing is pretty
self-explanatory.  The idea is not to do extensive search but use as
humane rules as possible.  Indeed, search goes as deep as 2 half-moves
at worst (mate situations) and rules are pretty close to what an
average player does in such endgame.  Understandably, not always does
the system find moves that lead to fastest mate.  However, most often
it finds some best move (or at least close).  As far as tested, it
always manages to checkmate.
